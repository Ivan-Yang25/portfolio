        Like all projects, it has field validation.
        You can also edit and delete some expenses and the budget value is updated in real time along with the graph.

        What makes this project special is that it has: <br>
        ✅Field validation to ensure that the information entered is correct.
        ✅Data persistence in localstorage to maintain a record of patients.
        ✅Patient editing and deletion functionality, making it a truly useful tool for patient management in a clinic.
        To build this project, I used Vite for the initial files, React for creating the interface, and TailwindCSS to give it a nice look. I also implemented Hooks like useEffect and useState, which are essential in developing React applications.'
